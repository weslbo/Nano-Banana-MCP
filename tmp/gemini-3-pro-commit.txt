feat(model): add Gemini 3 Pro image preview model support

Add comprehensive support for Google's Gemini 3 Pro image preview model
alongside the existing Gemini 2.5 Flash model, enabling users to choose
between fast generation and professional-quality output.

Key features:
- Dual model support: Gemini 2.5 Flash (fast) and Gemini 3 Pro (professional)
- High-resolution image generation (1K, 2K, 4K) for Gemini 3 Pro
- Custom aspect ratio support (1:1, 4:3, 3:4, 16:9, 9:16)
- Model-specific configuration with response modalities
- Enhanced text rendering capabilities for professional assets
- Backward-compatible with existing implementations (defaults to 2.5 Flash)

Implementation details:
- Added ImageModel, ImageResolution, and AspectRatio type definitions
- Extended all tools (generate_image, edit_image, continue_editing) with
  optional model, resolution, and aspectRatio parameters
- Implemented dynamic configuration builder for Gemini 3 Pro features
- Updated response text to indicate which model was used
- Enhanced documentation with model selection guide and workflows

Quality gates:
✅ Lint passed (eslint)
✅ Type-check passed (tsc --noEmit)
✅ Build passed (tsc)

Breaking changes: None
- All new parameters are optional
- Default behavior preserved (uses gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview)
- Existing API calls continue to work without modification

Documentation updates:
